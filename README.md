# METHOD: Deep generative model of genetic variation data improves imputation accuracy in private populations

Official repository for artificial genome generation and imputation using METHOD.

This repository is still being modified. In general, the Impute5 pipeline should not be used. It is made specifically for the single SNP imputation experiments and does not work well on clusters since a new VCF file needs to be created each time a SNP is dropped.
